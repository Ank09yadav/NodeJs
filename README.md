##  Project Overview

This repository contains a suite of Node.js tools designed to demonstrate modern backend development practices using **ES Modules**.

### 1. 📂 CLI File Manager (`fileManager.js`)
A powerful, interactive CLI tool to manage your file system directly from the terminal. It uses `readline` for user input and `chalk` for a colorful, user-friendly interface.

**Key Features:**
*   **Create Folders & Files:** Quickly generate new directories and standard files.
*   **Write Content:** Append or write text directly to files from the CLI.
*   **Delete Operations:** Safely remove files and directories.
*   **List Items:** View detailed directory contents with visual icons (📁/🗃️).
*   **Interactive Menu:** Easy-to-navigate numbered menu system.

### 2. 🖥️ System Monitor (`systemMonitor.js`)
A real-time dashboard script that monitors your machine's vital statistics.

**Key Features:**
*   **Real-time CPU Usage:** Tracks usage percentage across all CPU cores.
*   **Memory Management:** Visualizes Total vs. Used RAM in GB.
*   **Health Status:** Alerts if memory usage is "High" or "Normal".
*   **Auto-Refresh:** Updates stats every second for accurate monitoring.
